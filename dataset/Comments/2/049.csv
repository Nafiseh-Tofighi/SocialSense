Most see religious discrimination for what it actually is: enforcement of religion upon others through discrimination which is unconstitutional. Businesses aren‚Äôt forced to be in business and have other living options to choose from without enforcing their religions upon the public via discrimination. Just as Jim Crow and slavery were once legal doesn‚Äôt make it right.
