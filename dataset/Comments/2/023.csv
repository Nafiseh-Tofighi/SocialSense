All I said is “we don’t claim them” is not an Islamic term unless the act of the person has gone beyond the fold of Islam. You can certainly say their actions are heinous and unislamic but you don’t own Islam to “un-claim” anyone from it unless they’re very clearly deviated from the deen eg ISIS or reformists.""","=""https://www.instagram.com/rabiyya_reads""","=""https://scontent-ist1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/346378748_795117351974484_836886687204227819_n.jpg""","=""3/13/2021, 6:56:48 AM"""

"=""10816311461""","=""poison.appleheart.666""","=""18017976745917222""","=""Poverty and lack of modernization can lead people to become primitive in their thinking and therefore engage in honor killings. It is an issue that is all too pervasive in many countries, and perpetuated by the lack of stringent laws and protection for victims. People expect women to get married and have children, leading to a sort of unending cycle, while those in rich countries think rationally. Secularism is an important factor in the prevention of honor killings. Countries must have stronger laws to protect the victims and institutions must be put in place to help lower poverty, modernize education and foster equality. Ideally, with the correct implementation, honor killings could essentially be wiped out.
Ultimately, a combination of poverty, lack of modernization and unfair laws or expectations are the primary causes of honor killings. By implementing stronger laws and protection for victims, countries can create a stronger stance against honor killings and put an end to the cruelty. Additionally, progressive education systems, investments in poorer areas, and speaking out against discrimination all play a role in the prevention of honor killings. Although the issue may be difficult to solve, it can be eliminated if we put in the right efforts and make the necessary changes.""","=""https://www.instagram.com/poison.appleheart.666""","=""https://scontent-ist1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/278784420_740595740430724_6543379334048659328_n.jpg""","=""11/20/2023, 3:01:38 PM"""
