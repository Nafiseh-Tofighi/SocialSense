And if the Green party grows with more people who have these values, it could be an avenue for complete system change. In addition to the 4 pillars and 10 key values of the Green party platform, they have a very diverse, passionate, and educated activist working on the electoral and public policy part of the collective struggle. For instance, topics like cancelling student debt, free college, a Green New Deal including an economic bill of rights, and more were laughed at by the Republicrats, until the Dems co-opted public support with ppl like AOC and these ideas watered down to funnel money while looking helpful.

I often think about how our strategies need to be updated to fit the times (ex: marching was useful during the CRM given how Black Americans were not allowed to take up space in society, but it doesn’t have the same impact now) but your questions go beyond simply fighting back to what are we fighting for, and give direction on how to answer that. The call to reflect on who and how we were before oppression really resonates. ❤️Thank you.""","=""https://www.instagram.com/joye_de_sylva""","=""https://scontent-ist1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/410776343_333163822825042_893296861510802697_n.jpg""","=""5/14/2024, 6:47:01 AM"""
