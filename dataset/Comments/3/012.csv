The post is saying that people of color tend to be forced to live (i.e look at history of Red Lining in USA) neighborhoods closer to industry / etc than the suburban areas of cities that tend to be outside or further away from the direct effects of pollution - look at housing costs in your city today and compare rent in the inner city to rent in the suburbs, that is what the post is saying, bipoc people already have a tendency to lack the options to easily leave (or face state sanctioned or business sanctioned discrimination like that red lining i mentioned) for the suburbs and dont see options to easily lift themselves from poverty when they stay in those places - post is also just saying that because BIPOC people tend to live in those situations, they will also pay the biggest direct consequences of climate inaction and consequences of living near industry creating particulate pollution in cities.

If you are the state and you make it a point to cram bipoc people in your cities industrial areas as a base for cheap labor and because white people dont want them in the suburbs, deny them access to credit, etc (again, go read about red lining lol its like youre unaware), those people also end up paying the consequences of what its like living near all that industry, hence post saying its bipoc people who will suffer most from particulate issues in air.
