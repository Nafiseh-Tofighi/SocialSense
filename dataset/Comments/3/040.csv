My conflation of asphyxia and suffocation does not change the fact that visible injury is not required to die from these conditions. You have no evidence that such visible injuries are required. Tolerance actually does mean that there's less of a physiological effect - this is known as physiological tolerance. To use your example with guys drinking whiskey, the guy who has alcohol tolerance will literally be less drunk (not just better composed, which is behavorial tolerance) than the guy without tolerance due to the changes in the amounts of GABA receptors in his brain. I already addressed your misconception about the """"lethal"""" levels of drugs in his system (it's """"lethal"""" for someone without opoid tolerance, which he had given he was an opoid addict for years). And how a lack of injury to his neck doesn't mean that he didn't die fron. At least you kinda answered my question - it seems like your motivation for these mental gymnastics is """"political tribalism"""" rather than racism or a pro-cop bias. Since your political tribe has made a vested effort in questioning the medical experts (such as the coroners of both autospies), you are therefore motivated to deny the evidence that Floyd was murdered in favor of your political tribe's preferred explaination that he died from an overdose.
