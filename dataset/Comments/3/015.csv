1: A white gradient starting at the lower left corner of the image fades into blue in the background with a graph paper overlay. A black arch extends from the right with the words “How is our planet changing?” wrapping around the top and left. The blue marble image of Earth from space is on the right side of the image.

2: Part of the blue marble image of Earth from space peeks over the left edge, with a brown to orange gradient along the border, and accent lines that resemble graph paper. In the center of the image is an arrow pointing upward with the text “Carbon Dioxide 425 parts per million.” White text in the bottom right reads: “CO2 hit another record high this spring and continues to rise each year.”

3: Part of the blue marble image of Earth from space is in the bottom right corner, with an orange to pink gradient along the border, and accent lines that resemble graph paper. The main text on the image reads: “Global Temperature 1.4 °C since preindustrial,” with an arrow pointing upward. White text near the bottom of the image reads: “Global temperatures pushed higher than at any time since 1880.”

4: Part of the blue marble image of Earth from space is shown in the bottom left corner, with a pink to purple gradient along the border, and accent lines that look like a spherical grid. The main text on the image reads: “Methane 1932 parts per billion” with an arrow pointing upward.
