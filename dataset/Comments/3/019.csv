You'd get one if you were on your way to work or waiting for a train, sure, but usually you'd be getting a coffee with someone and you'd sit down for a spell. It's more about community and taking a break than fueling up for a day's work. In the US, people get coffee to keep going and/or be productive. Elsewhere, people get coffee to take a break and share with each other. In fact, that's also why there are still so many places in Italy and Spain that ban laptop use in the caf√©s.
