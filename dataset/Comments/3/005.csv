Yes -

we have been introducing new pharmaceuticals and new chemical and manufacturing elements into waterways that are just not even measured for under safe, drinking water and clean water laws‚Ä¶ 

Unfortunately, in the 90s, when we had a chance to expand testing and correct the levels for known carcinogens, and other effluents known to have horrid health AND environmental impacts, the climate, deniers and chemical manufacturers attacked the EPA, ran extended, smear, campaigns, and undermined both the clean water act which regulates pollution, and the drinking water act, which would test for chemical levels and drinking water - testing frequency was rolled back, some alert levels were shifted in the wrong direction, and no new items were listed (think Round Up). 

The same party legislators have repealed funding and have since attempted to put violators in positions in these agencies, certain administrations for whom both oversight and expertise are a problem to be denied, effectively caused a brain drain from a number of federal agencies responsible for health, safety, and community protections against corporate perpetrators who‚Äôd rather pay infrequent and paltry fines than play nice (or clean up their own mess - or better yet, prevent them).""","=""https://www.instagram.com/randall.cauley""","=""https://scontent-ist1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/298912814_3319205391701113_692250971431179498_n.jpg""","=""3/4/2024, 10:24:44 PM"""
