This time I feel like we have to dig a little deeper. Austria (where I live) is blessed with hydro power and we were lucky enough to cover over 60% of electricity needed with hydro power since the late 90’s I believe. This did improve even more and we actually might make it to 100% until 2030 (even though due to the rise of needed electricity the percentage went down in the last two years). So this does look okay. But if you look at Austrias CO2 footprint, we’re actually one of the worst countries within the EU who have only decreased last year for the first time compared to 1990 (by 6%) compared to an average decrease of almost 30% in the EU. Austria climate policy needs to get a whole lot better and we really need to catch up to the rest of the EU""","=""https://www.instagram.com/mnachtschatt""","=""https://scontent-ist1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/47585112_345847526004247_2437521720052023296_n.jpg""","=""3/3/2024, 10:21:06 PM"""
