Although, while women have historically faced more oppression and discrimination, rigid gender roles and expectations can be harmful for men too. 

For example, the expectation that men must be strong, stoic providers places immense pressure on men. 

The feminist movement seeks to break down these restrictive gender norms for everyone. It wants people to be free to express themselves and pursue opportunities regardless of their gender. This allows men to explore their emotions, nurturing sides, and interests without judgement. It gives them more freedom and flexibility in family roles as well.

When it comes to climate change, rising temperatures disproportionately impact women in developing countries. However, climate change is a human issue that requires all of us to mobilize for solutions — and we agree on that. 

As part of pursuing gender equality, the feminist movement emphasizes that women must have a seat at the table in climate policy making and adaptation efforts. 

This ultimately leads to more inclusive, effective climate action that benefits everyone!🙏🏼""","=""https://www.instagram.com/itschiaraelle""","=""https://scontent-ist1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/430751622_1758339888020320_1915399976230493759_n.jpg""","=""3/2/2024, 2:00:13 PM"""

And when it comes to concrete policy that affect their daily lives, it gets even more difficult. Be it replacing heaters and cars, renovating, reducing consumption in general, … it gets difficult.

It's still great if you use the bike instead of a car without thinking about feminism. However gender and sex affects virtually all of your life, so it is a relevant thing to consider when making policy for everyone.""","=""https://www.instagram.com/yuwasheu""","=""https://scontent-ist1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/436220958_1934705663639952_4797408235581352698_n.jpg""","=""3/1/2024, 11:58:11 PM"""
