However, in case it comment will enlighten someone else I want everyone to know that we are not far removed from History to say that was a long time ago.  Our past molded who we are today And just because we have very successful Black people doesn't mean the struggle is over.  We finally had a Black President, yet he is multiracial his mother was white.  Yes, things have improved for us I want deny it, but many injustices are still prevalent many of our youth and in our community are targeted and killed by police.  She screamed do what you are told!  Many did and was still killed during traffic stops.  I know how it feels to be targeted and I've seen 1st hand Black men of all classes being racial profiled.  As far as Black on Black crime that is a narrative from our non supporters to discredit us.  Yes, there is crime in Black areas just like non black neighborhoods.  Yet, why are we the only people where its worded that way?  We could say White on White crime Latino on Latino crime.  So forth and so forth. The fact is people commit crimes in there own neighborhoods anybody does.  And to answer about do you have to be whole Black to be oppressed the answer is No.  This conversation is multifaceted.  It could go on for days.  I leave you with this.  Get your facts the way news use to do back in the day.  They got it from the source and didn't influence it with their own opinion or views.
